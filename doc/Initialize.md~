Before start using the Dr. Inventor Framework in your Java code, by means of the Factory class (see [Javadoc](http://backingdata.org/dri/library/latest/javadoc.html)) it is possible to programmatically set the following paper processing options:

## Which PDF to text converter to use?
When the Dr. Inventor Framework has to process a PDF paper, we need to extract semi-structured textual contents from the PDF file in order to enalbe any further analysis of the article. To this purpose, the Dr. Inventor Framework integrates two PDF-to-text converters tailored to scientific publications:

 + [PDFX](http://pdfx.cs.man.ac.uk/): is an on-line Web service that converts PDF papers to structured textual formats including XML.

 + [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) - version 0.4.1: is a Java based PDF-to-text conversion software customized to scientific publications.


It is possible to choose which one of the previous tools to use in order to convert a PDF paper to XML by means of the following code:  
```java
// To use PDFX:
Factory.setPDFtoTextConverter(PDFtoTextConvMethod.PDFX);

// To use GROBID:
Factory.setPDFtoTextConverter(PDFtoTextConvMethod.GROBID);
```  

After initializing the Factory class, all the subsequent PDF-to-text conversion will exploit the chosen tool.
