#Installation

In order to properly use the Dr. Inventor Text Mining Framework you need to satisfy the following requirements and perform the installation steps described hereinafter.

## System requirements
In order to use the Dr. Inventor Text Mining Framework you should:
* use *Java 1.8*
* set the maximum [Java Heap Space](https://www.mkyong.com/java/find-out-your-java-heap-memory-size/) equal or greater than *5Gb* (by means of Virtual Machine arguments -Xmx4500m, or by means of system properties)


## How to import and configure the library in your java project

In order to import the Dr. Inventor Text Mining Framework in your java project you have to perform the following two steps:

### STEP 1: Import the java library
There are two approaches to import the Dr. Inventor Text Mining Framework java library:
1. If you are using Maven, add to the POM of your Maven project the following repository:

```javascript
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>backingdata-repo</id>
		<name>Backingdata repository</name>
		<url>http://backingdata.org/dri/library/mavenRepo/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```
and the following dependency (the number of the latest version of the Dr. Inventor Text Mining Framework can be retrieved on the top of the [Index page](Index)):

```javascript
<dependency>
	<groupId>edu.upf.taln.dri</groupId>
	<artifactId>lib</artifactId>
	<version>LATEST-VERSION-NUMBER-GOES-HERE</version>
</dependency>
```

2. If you want to import directly the library together with all its dependencies in your java code, download the JAR / dependencies at the following link  jar of the library together the libraries it depends on (lib folder).

### STEP 2: Configure the library
once imported the library and its dependences, the following step should be carried out:
1. Download and extract Dr. Inventor Library Resources directory in $DRI_RESOURCE_DIR_PATH
2. Download Dr. Inventor Library Property file as $DRI_PROPERTY_FILE_PATH
3. when executing a java program that imports and uses the Dr. Inventor Library, set the following virtual machine arguments:
    * -DDRIpropertyFile=$DRI_PROPERTY_FILE_PATH (mandatory): local absolute path to Dr. Inventor Library property file. It is possible to download this file locally here. Once downloaded, it is needed edit the local copy of the Dr. Inventor Library property file by setting the property "resourceFolder.fullPath" equal to the Dr. Inventor Library Resources directory local path (without trailing slash, for instance: /home/mydir/DRIresources-2.1).
    * -Xmx4500m (optional): maximum Java Heap (>= 4,5Gb)
 

## How to update from an older version
IMPORTANT: When updating from an older version of the library to the version 2.1, please, remember to:
If the library is imported by Maven, update your project Maven POM with then new library version number
If the JAR of the library is directly imported, Download the new JAR files of the library together with its dependencies
Download the new Dr. Inventor Library Resources directory
Download the new Dr. Inventor Library Property file. Replace this file to the old Dr. Inventor Library Property file if any. Modify the contents of this file by specifying the local path of the new Dr Inventor Library Resources directory
